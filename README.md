# Solution for "Numbers Between Two Arrays"

## Problem Description

The task involves finding integers that satisfy the following conditions:

Each element of the first array (a) must be a factor of the integer.

The integer must be a factor of each element of the second array (b).

These integers are said to be "between" the two arrays. The goal is to determine the count of such integers.

## Example

Input:

a = [2, 4]

b = [16, 32, 96]

Output: 3 (The integers 4, 8, and 16 satisfy the conditions.)


## Approach

To solve the problem, the following approach was taken:

1. Define the Range of Potential Integers

The smallest candidate integer is the maximum value in the first array (max(a)), as any valid number must be divisible by all elements of a.

The largest candidate integer is the minimum value in the second array (min(b)), as any valid number must divide all elements of b.

2. Iterate Through the Range

For each integer in the range [max(a), min(b)], check if it satisfies the two conditions:

It is divisible by all elements in a.

It divides all elements in b.

3. Check the Conditions

Condition 1: Use the all() function to verify that the integer is divisible by every element of a.

Condition 2: Use the all() function to verify that the integer divides every element of b.

4. Count Valid Integers

If an integer satisfies both conditions, increment the count.

5. Return the Result

Finally, return the total count of integers that meet the criteria.


# Explanation of the Code

Finding the Range:

The range of potential integers is [max(a), min(b)].

In the sample input, max(a) = 4 and min(b) = 16, so the range is [4, 16].

Iterating and Checking Conditions:

For each number in the range, we check:

If it is divisible by all elements of a (e.g., 4 % 2 == 0, 4 % 4 == 0).

If it divides all elements of b (e.g., 16 % 4 == 0, 32 % 4 == 0, 96 % 4 == 0).

Counting Valid Integers:

For each valid number, the count is incremented.

Output:

The function returns the count of integers that satisfy the conditions.

## Key Concepts Used

Modulus Operator (%): To check divisibility.

all() Function: To validate conditions for all elements in a list.

Iterative Loops: To check each number in the defined range.

## How I Solved It

* I analyzed the problem to understand the conditions required.
* 
* I broke the solution into smaller steps, focusing on defining the range and verifying the conditions.
* 
* I wrote the implementation incrementally, testing each part with sample inputs.
* 
* I optimized the range of numbers to reduce unnecessary iterations.

## Edge Cases Considered

Single Element Arrays:

a = [1], b = [1] → Result: 1 (Only 1 satisfies both conditions).

No Valid Numbers:

a = [3], b = [7] → Result: 0 (No number satisfies both conditions).

Large Input Range:

Ensured the implementation works efficiently within the constraints (1 ≤ a[i], b[j] ≤ 100).

Sample Inputs and Outputs

Conclusion

This solution efficiently identifies and counts the integers between two arrays by leveraging mathematical properties and Python's built-in functions. The approach ensures clarity, correctness, and adherence to problem constraints.
